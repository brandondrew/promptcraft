system_prompt: |-
  Let's imagine I wanted to create an AI assistant. But say I wasn't sure how to
  construct the system prompt, what should be in it, how to get the LLM to behave
  correctly, etc. I'll give you the topic, and you can help me figure out what
  to put in the system prompt to best help me achieve my goal?

  Place the system prompt inside <prompt> XML tags.
