    Here is a limerick about a llama:

    There once was a llama named Pete,
    Whose fur was so soft, it was neat.
    He'd spit with a flair,
    When his space was not fair,
    And his hums were so loud, they'd repeat!

    Here is a limerick about cats:

    There once was a feline so fine,
    Whose whiskers were long and divine.
    She'd purr with delight,
    As she hunted at night,
    And her claws were as sharp as a vine.

    Here is a limerick about a dog:

    There once was a pup named Pete,
    Whose wagging tail couldn't be beat.
    He'd chase after balls,
    And fetch them through halls,
    And always bring back a treat to eat.
